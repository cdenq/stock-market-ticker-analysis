## About VBA Scripting

`VBA Scripting` is a VBA data analytics endeavor that:
1) loops through multiple cells on multiple sheets

This project builds on the skills from the `excel-challenge` [here](https://github.com/cdenq/excel-challenge).

- `multiple_year_stock_data_main.xlsm` is the main workbook where the VBA code was applied
- `alphabetical_testing.xlsm` is a test workbook where I developed the VBA code
